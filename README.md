# BoomZap
BoomZap is a simple Asteroids-style arcade game made for Linux.

Right now this repo is messy because this project is just for fun.

The executable is in build-dir/ with everything it needs like the vertex and frag
shaders along with a font file.

I have successfully ported BoomZap to Windows so my friends could play, and I'll try
to get everything necessary for cross-compiling it on here in the vaguely near future.
I'll also cross-compile it for Mac at some point.

Feel free to use any of the ideas or code for BoomZap; just credit me if you do!
